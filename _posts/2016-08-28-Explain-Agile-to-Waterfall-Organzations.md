Agile is one of those industry buzz-words that everyone seems to need to know.  Whether you’re looking for a job and find yourself using that buzzword on your resume to land an interview, or you’re trying to explain why your software dev project is behind schedule and over budget, I can nearly guarantee one thing - we’re all saying the word, but we don’t really know what it means.

Let’s try a little word association - when I say Agile, tell me the first word that comes to mind.  Is it “iterative?”  How about “scope?”  Maybe “PM,” “Scrum,” or “quick?”  

I can tell you from the many client interactions I’ve had on the topic, most people say that Agile is “Well, it’s not waterfall.  I’ve tried it but it doesn’t work.”  If you’re lucky, you might get a client that says “I like Agile, but the people around here don’t.  They could never get used to that way of things.”

So what do you do if you have comments like these or clients that don’t understand the process?  In fact, what on earth is Agile anyway?  In short, Agile is a development methodology with 4 key values (and 12 principles):

Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
Working software over comprehensive documentation
Customer collaboration over contract negotiation and
Responding to change over following a plan (agilemanifesto.org).

What does all of that mean?  Well, Agile is a way to develop products (or anything for that matter), with an emphasis on those 4 key values - in other words, let’s throw out the assumption that we know everything about a project at the beginning, let’s collaborate with our client over the life of the project so that we can take their input into account, let’s figure out the people and processes aspects before limiting ourselves with tools, and let’s focus on making working, non-buggy software from the get-go.  Wow.  Imagine if all of your products worked like that!

So, how do we actually make this happen?  There are a myriad of Agile like frameworks we could choose, but that’s not the point of Agile.  The Scrum Master title, length of a development iteration, and framework of choice aside, it’s those values that the client is going to buy into, not the framework of choice.

Here’s what I mean.  

When you tell your client (and consequently show them) that you’re going to partner with them instead of dictating what they can and can’t do with a solution, they’ll begin to relax.  When you tell them that you’re going to focus on understanding their processes and people and optimizing whatever you build based on their business instead of what’s easiest, they’ll begin to trust that you care about them.  When you insist on writing bug-free code instead of going used-car salesman on them with a lengthy features list, they will begin to lower their resistance.  

The key to Agile, and getting your client to trust you and the process, is to show them that this whole Agile idea was designed for THEM.  People got so sick of failed projects, coming in contact with every CIO’s fear of $10 million spent and not a piece of functioning code to show for it, and outdated, unusable products, that they decided enough was enough.  Is that what they would like to avoid?  Would they like to have a say in what to prioritize, to see how well their ideas work in the business, and to rest easy knowing that they’re an avid part of the development?

The key to helping your client understand Agile development is to focus on these values, because they’re values that we all, well, value - from the board of directors, all of the way down to the average joe that makes the business run.  We can all get behind the idea that software works for ME, not the other way around

Next, let’s check out this diagram and take a look at why we value these things, keeping in mind that step 4 assumes we get where we wanted to get in the end, framework agnostic.

By assuming things will change and by focusing on functioning code, we can get our product out to the user to test, adjust, and refactor before the last-minute rush to go live (See Usability Testing posts for more info).  Each step along the way, we can adapt and adjust, building the best product we can instead of sticking to our guns at the beginning with the limited knowledge we originally had.  Instead of a grandiose plan of every feature we can think of and attempting to add a dollar sign quote to its cost, which we are REALLY bad at doing as humans (See "Agile Estimating and Planning" by Mike Cohn), we can build exactly what we need, prioritize our spending to optimize the return on our development, and get the whole organization bought into the effort simultaneously.  It’s an incredibly powerful process and partnership with the development team and a plan that any client can get behind.
