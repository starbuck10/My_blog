So what exactly is usability testing?  And how does it compare with Design or User Acceptance Testing?  Is there a process I should follow to make sure I'm doing it right?  

Those questions, and others,are what this series is designed to explain.  We'll aim to hit about 10 posts, focusing on a particular aspect of usability testing in each one.

So let's start off with an introduction - what exactly is usability testing?

In essence, usability testing merges the science of psychology, engineering, human factor design, and cognitive and social science to determine HOW individuals use products and systems.  The focus here isn't on how visually appealing you make the experience (although a part of the UX/Design process takes this into account) but, rather, to make the product you're making as usable as possible.  That's it.  If you can understand who your users are and how they use things, and then take those considerations into account, you will make an incredible product.

Here's some quick history- In its infancy, usability testing originated in the world of Usability Engineering, a field that studies human and system interaction, providing input into how to increase user friendliness, efficiency, and design elegance.  This concept of human factored design began shortly after WWII, first in the UK with the Ergonomics Research Society and later in the US with the Human Factors Society, with the goal of building products that are easy to use, designed for the user (instead of the user being forced to figure it out), and limiting fatigue, mistakes, and environmental effects surrounding their use (referenced above as efficiency and design elegance).  Which you can imagine, was pretty important following a World War.  

So what does that have to do with software of product design?

How many times have you heard this statement: "All our users need is a quick walk-through on how to use it and they'll be fine."  Sound familiar?  I can't tell you how many times I've hard that statement.  At face value, sure, it makes sense, right?  I mean, how can you expect users to just pick-up something new if they've never seen it before?  Well, we have a problem.  In Jesse James Garrett's book, "The Elements of User Experience: User-Centered Design for the Web and Beyond," and in many other UX centered books for that matter, the author points out this issue and elaborates on a concept that all designers and developers need to be aware of:

"Web sites [and software] are complicated pieces of technology, and something funny happens when people have trouble using complicated pieces of technology: They blame themselves.  They feel like they must have done something wrong...  They feel stupid."

The trouble is that instead of users blaming the designers and developers of the software for not making the product usable enough, they blame their own incompetency and, ultimately, don't use it anymore.  Just imagine how many users you're losing because they find your product not very intuitive.

I had a professor once, <a href="https://www.extension.harvard.edu/faculty-directory/david-s-platt">David S. Platt</a>, who said, "Always remember - you are not your user and your user is not you."  He elaborates further in his book "Why Software Sucks" by saying, "Unless you're writing programs for a bunch of burned out computer geeks, your user isn't you. ... This is very hard to get through somebody's head; it's very hard to get rid of this notion that what you like your user is going to like... Again, your user is not you."

Throughout this series, we're going to visit why the concept of "Know Thy User" is so important and why it should be at the forefront of our design and development.
