The premise of innovation is a love of discovery - identifying new ways to do things, new products to wow the world, building new models to explain why things work the way they do.  The antithesis of innovation is sameness and mediocrity; doing things the way we’ve always done them.  I’m sure you’ve heard the quote attributed to Albert Einstein(and arguably, he probably never said it), “Insanity: doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results."  Regardless of the quote's attribution, we simply cannot do things better tomorrow if we're stuck in the world of yesterday.  And thinking otherwise is truly insanity.

The lifeblood of innovation, this love of discovery, is brainstorming; groups of people coming together with the understanding that we may not know how to solve our problem and we may not have all of the answers, but we’re sure going to try and figure it out together.  

Some believe that there are those of us simply destined to be the innovators of the world.  Tom Kelley, a general manager at IDEO, wrote in his book "The Art of Innovation([found here](http://amzn.to/2cXF9tB))", "we believe that the myth of the lone genius can actually hamper a company's efforts at innovation and creativity[70]."  Arguably the most successful design firm in history, IDEO's cultural beliefs go further in stating, "enlightened trial and error succeeds over the planning of the lone geniuses[[Dateline](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M66ZU2PCIcM)]."

The structure of a brainstorming session is pretty simple - a group of multi-disciplined, diverse team members look at a problem without the baggage of current processes and solutions and ideate through possible solutions.  The purpose of a brainstorming session isn’t to walk away from a 60-90 minute session with all of your questions answered or to garner buy-in for a plan that’s already decided but to look at the problem with a fresh perspective, generating ideas for how to overcome hurdles and putting together a plan for how to proceed.

Before coming into the brainstorming session, do your homework; nothing kills a brainstorming session quicker than everyone arriving to the room with no background or understanding on the topic of discussion.  Once the topic of discussion is established (maybe the type of product or service in discussion or even simply defining the problem statement), have a member or two dig into the history of the problem, current trends, market research, provide a synopsis of the opinions of experts, and outline need-to-know data and information that can quickly bring each member up to speed on the problem at hand - 10-15 minutes of information at most.  This approach ensures a team-wide baseline of information so that ideas can be generated quickly.

Before the brainstorming session begins, establish rules for team member interaction - cultures that promote psychological safety and creativity are excellent conduits for brainstorming sessions.  I had the privilege of taking a course with Richard Kasperowski (Visit his [blog](http://kasperowski.com)) over the summer that introduced me to a fantastic way to establish social norms and promote psychological safety among teams.  Referred to as the Core Protocols ([found here](http://amzn.to/2czkDk2)), this guideline for interactions between team members, originally proposed by Jim and Michelle McCarthy([Software for Your Head](http://amzn.to/2cSskoF)), is an excellent example of how to establish trust and acceptance between individuals, especially among newly formed teams with differing personalities.  If you're using the Core Protocols, make sure each member is aware and begin with a quick check-in to get things started.

Even if you don't have an established, predefined set of rules for team member interaction, like the Core Protocols, spend some time laying the ground work for interaction; no personal attacks, have thick skin, let someone finish their thoughts before cutting in, etc.  It may seem silly to put rules on interaction the first time you do it but establishing pre-defined boundaries provides a sense of security to those who may be softer spoken or more introverted, allowing the free-flow of ideas from opinions that don't always originate from the loudest or most persistent in the room.

Each brainstorming session should begin with a clearly defined problem statement and objectives for the meeting.  Good examples of a problem statement might be, "How do we improve product x so that it's easier for our users to handle" or "How can we help our clients understand what we do so that we can help them with their business problems."  The idea is to keep the problem statement outward facing on the users, even if the brainstorming session applies to internal business matters.  For instance, if you're on a team that's trying to streamline the time it takes to process reimbursement requests for your company, a good problem statement might be "how can we get employees paid as quickly and easily as possible?"  

Inward facing problem statements like "how do we reduce our processing time by 50%" tend to exacerbate the problem because thoughts immediately gravitate toward adjusting current processes without looking for new and innovative ways to approach the problem.  In this instance, the team is tempted to adjust the process in place and rely on current assumptions and restrictions, but perhaps the current process and its assumptions are the issue - with inward facing problem statements, we're setting the team up for failure from the get-go.  After all, the reason we're in business at all is because of our users; let's do them a favor and approach our problems from their perspective.

After addressing the problem statement, begin to air out all of your assumptions, even those you didn’t know you were working under.  "We know users do ____."  Why do you know they do that?  Have you personally observed users or conducted usability testing to determine how users are actually using the product?  "Our users are asking for ____."  Are they asking for that functionality because of the requirements and restrictions of the current software?  Perhaps the current software isn't what they truly need.  Regardless of how simple the assumption may appear, take the time to document it and understand if its an assumption you should be working under going forward.

The next part of the brainstorming session is the most fun - generate new ideas, no matter how difficult they might be to implement, how silly they might seem, how impossible they could be with current infrastructure and business policy to enact, or the difficulty of turning a big ship onto a new course.  Go for volume at this point, number each idea, and let the conversation flow.  This isn't the time to go around the room person by person but to let the natural flow of conversation generate new and interesting ideas and approaches to the problem.  If conversation ever stagnates, jump back a few steps and elaborate on previous ideas, or approach the problem from a slightly different angle.

When generating your ideas, don’t lose site of who your users are.  This is not the time or the place for focus groups, gut feelings, or personal bias to taint the realm of possibility, as I mentioned above.  Are you sure that’s how your users actually use the product?  Go out and do some more homework - observe your users in action with your own eyes - in the words of Tom Kelley from IDEO, “we don’t want to peek at the answers before we know the questions [32].”

Get your hands on these ideas - prototype and discover why certain things work and certain things don’t.  If a member of the group comes up with an interesting idea, give it a quick try.  Sketch what the product might look like on a sticky note and slap it up on the board, grab a dry-erase marker and draft out what the new process could look like, or work on your shop and origami skills by folding some paper or playing around with styrofoam and some dowel rods.  Hack together a model to help the team understand what you're talking about and spawn newer and more inventive ideas in the process.

After ideas are generated, spend some time reviewing what was discussed and beginning identifying the most interesting to explore in further detail.  These ideas shouldn't always be the most likely to succeed but should incorporate areas to explore that could provide continued insight.  Maybe exploring a cutting-edge technology might not result in its usage in your final product, but the design and approach it takes to solve a problem could provide much needed insight into your own problem statement (time well spent).  I good approach to deciding which ideas to pursue in greater detail is to use dot-voting.  Each team member has x number of dots to put on ideas on the board - the ideas with the most dots on the board are those that are pursued in greater detail and/or given priority for hours and funding.  

Here are some common traps to avoid to keep an atmosphere of openness and creativity in your brainstorming sessions:

<b>1. Negativity</b>
It's really easy to find fault in someone's idea and it's also the quickest way to kill the creative process.  If someone's idea is criticized as silly or unrealistic or too difficult, the team has no motivation to speak up.  Even with the best intentions in mind, leave negativity at the door..  

<b>2. Analyzing ideas in depth</b>
Our first reaction to an idea is to see if it has merit and to put it through the ringer of common sense and feasibility.  Allow ideas to generate and develop but be sure not to rule anything out before every idea is presented.  There will be plenty of time to discuss how well an idea might actually work after more information is gathered and before it hit production.

<b>3. “That’s not what users want / That's not how they use our products.”</b>
I can't speak to this pitfall enough.  Users are human and change their wants, needs, and desires often - you can't expect them, or their business objectives, to stay the same forever.  Spend some time in the trenches with your users and observe what they do.  In the words of Tom Kelley,
"Successful innovations recognize that people don't always do the 'right' thing or make the necessary leaps to bridge the gap between familiar and genuinely new ideas.  Widespread adoption often takes time.  Astute observation is one way to shorten that cycle and make tradeoffs that users will accept[45]."

<b>4. Letting the boss lead </b>
Brainstorming sessions aren't the venue for the team to praise the boss' ideas or to give the illusion of employees having a voice - bosses that speak up first will inevitably taint the discussion and force conversation to run a very confined and intentional direction.  Innovation and creativity must be allowed to run its course without these factors coming into play.  Bosses - empower your team and reward those that are high-performers.

<b>5. Too specialized of a team </b>
There is much to be said about diversity, both in people and ideas.  It's really difficult to have new ideas when the team all thinks the same and approaches the problem from the same angle.  Is everyone in the room an engineer?  Try asking someone with a background in design to join in.  Or maybe a school teacher who doesn't have the same kind of technical expertise.  Or maybe a theoretical physicist.  People with differing backgrounds will provide experience and insight that a homogenous group of developers never can.
