The premise of innovation is a love of discovery - identifying new ways to do things, new products to wow the world, building new models to explain why things work the way they do.  The antithesis of innovation is sameness and mediocrity; doing things the way we’ve always done them.  I’m sure you’ve heard the quote attributed to Albert Einstein, “Insanity: doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results."  We simply cannot do things better tomorrow if we're stuck in the world of yesterday.  And thinking otherwise is truly insanity.

The lifeblood of innovation, this love of discovery, is brainstorming; groups of people coming together with the understanding that we may not know how to solve our problem and we may not have all of the answers, but we’re sure going to try and figure it out.  

Some believe that there are those of us simply destined to be the innovators of the world.  Tom Kelley, a general manager at IDEO, likes to say, "we believe that the myth of the lone genius can actually hamper a company's efforts at innovation and creativity[source]."  Arguably the most successful design firm in history, IDEO's culture goes further in saying, "enlightened trial and error succeeds over the planning of the lone geniuses[source]."

The structure of a brainstorming session is pretty simple - a group of multi-disciplined, diverse team members look at a problem without the baggage of current processes and solutions and ideate through possible solutions.  The purpose of a brainstorming session isn’t to walk away from a 60-90 minute session with all of your questions answered or to garner buy-in for a plan that’s already decided but to look at the problem with a fresh perspective, generating ideas for how to overcome hurdles and putting together a plan for how to proceed.



Before coming into the brainstorming session, do your hw

Establish rules for team member interaction - cultures that promote psychological safety and creativity are excellent conduits for brainstorming sessions (include discussion on the core protocols and a quote from richard kasperowski)

Each brainstorming session should begin with a clearly defined problem statement

Air out all of your assumptions, even those you didn’t know you were working under.  

Generate new ideas, no matter how difficult they might be to implement, how impossible they could be with current infrastructure and business policy to enact, or the difficulty of turning a big ship onto a new course.  Go for volume at this point…

When generating your ideas, don’t lose site of who your users are.  This is not the time or the place for focus groups, gut feelings, or personal bias to taint the realm of possibility.  Are you sure that’s how your users actually use the product?  Go out and do some homework - observe your users in action with your own eyes - in the words of Tom Kelley from IDEO, “we don’t want to peek at the answers before we know the questions.”

Get your hands on these ideas - Prototype (fail early and fail often) - discover why certain things work and certain things don’t.

Here are some common traps to avoid to keep an atmosphere of openness and creativity in your brainstorming sessions:

1. negativity
2. analyzing ideas before all ideas are generated
3. “That’s not what our customers want.”
4. Letting the boss lead
5. Too focused of a team (not allowing new ideas permeate the discussion)
