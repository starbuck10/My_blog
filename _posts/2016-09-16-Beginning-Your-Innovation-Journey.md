<b>Beginning Your Innovation Journey</b>

If I were to pick the single greatest buzzword of the last 25 years, it would be “innovation.”  From the massive adoption of the internet and social media to Apple’s iPhone and Elon Musk’s Tesla, the world has seen a tremendous explosion of new products, new services, and a new way of doing business.  Daily, I’m bombarded with emails on the latest product invention, the newest SaaS offering, and business philosophies promising a quicker way to complete my work, to make my life easier, or simply guarantee to be so disruptive that I will have to change the comfortable and familiar way I do things going forward.  Let’s face it - our world is in a constant state of flux.  And to be successful in it, we need to be okay with that and learn to adopt a similar mindset.

The idea of innovation isn’t a new one - we can date the first appearance of this “modern” technological explosion to the industrial revolution, where traditionally family run businesses had to adopt new ways to create widgets faster and cheaper than the competition to stay in business.  We can see it from observing the effect of automative manufacturing techniques (read: Henry Ford’s moving assembly line, est. Dec 1913) when we see hundreds of manufacturers defunct by the end of the 1920s.  Each new disruptive innovation forces businesses to adapt to a new way of doing business, removing themselves from only responding to their current, high-paying customer’s needs and expectations, and face an unproven future, or face inevitable irrelevance and eventual bankruptcy.  In Clayton Christensen’s book, “The Innovator’s Dilemma ([find it here](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0062060244/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0062060244&linkCode=as2&tag=joshuacoffie1-20&linkId=b4b74d9e12481d79dd03a713dd3671bf)),” he describes the process as such:

“Successful companies want their resources to be focused on activities that address customers' needs, that promise higher profits, that are techno logically feasible, and that help them play in substantial markets. Yet, to expect the processes that accomplish these things also to do something like nurturing disruptive technologies—to focus resources on proposals that customers reject, that offer lower profit, that underperform existing technologies and can only be sold in insignificant markets—is akin to flapping one's arms with wings strapped to them in an attempt to fly. Such expectations involve fighting some fundamental tendencies about the way successful organizations work and about how their performance is evaluated [Christensen, 98].”

The idea is simple - disruptive organizations have lower overhead, a scrappy fighting mentality, and the agility to model and adapt their product or service into something that current customers do not yet know that they need.  Instead of fighting in the same space as the established “big dogs” of industry, they approach problems from the perspective of “how do we do this differently and better,” jumping into the fray of ambiguity and uncertainty, willing to look outside the answers of today to explore potential answers of tomorrow.

Is this, then, the formula for success; look for products and approaches that are different and capitalize on them as quickly as possible?  The research would say no - 3 out 4 venture capitalist backed startup firms don’t return the investment put into them ([Source](http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10000872396390443720204578004980476429190)).  Other statistics from the Illinois Small Business Development Center (SBDC) at the Turner Center for Entrepreneurship says that by year 4, 50% of startups are out of business([Source](http://www.statisticbrain.com/startup-failure-by-industry)).  Imagine going to your boss with those kinds of statistics and asking for funding to pursue clients that you don’t have with a product or service they don’t know that they want, all the while remaining unprofitable until the new technology gains traction.  Business school and good business sense says they’d be crazy to say yes.

And yet Clayton Christensen writes, “…many of what are now widely accepted principles of good management are, in fact, only situationally appropriate. There are times at which it is right not to listen to customers, right to invest in developing lower-performance products that promise lower margins,and right to aggressively pursue small, rather than substantial, markets [xii].”  Embracing this realization is the only way to not be caught off-guard by the entrance of a new, disruptive product or service.

But can a company value constant innovation and still remain profitable?  Let’s take Alphabet, Inc as an example- arguably one of the most successful companies in existence, Alphabet boasts business units like Google, Nest, and Mobile and slightly more “explorative” units, like X, Nest, and self-driving cars.  In the words of Alphabet. “We’ve long believed that over time companies tend to get comfortable doing the same thing, just making incremental changes. But in the technology industry, where revolutionary ideas drive the next big growth areas, you need to be a bit uncomfortable to stay relevant ([Source](https://abc.xyz/)).”  Boasting an 18% revenue increase in 2015 to $21.33 billion, it’s easy to see that a company dedicated to innovation can actually be successful.

What about the rest of us - can we leverage the principles of innovation to turn our often behemoth, dinosaur like organizations into agile, proactive, and successful teams?

The transition to innovation begins with a shift in organizational mindset and business strategy - beginning with an understanding of your business structure and capabilities, your current and potential markets, and the focus of innovative research and development you should pursue.  This transition can  be somewhat painful in organizations that like to do “business as usual,” much in the same way it takes considerable effort to transition from a waterfall organization to an agile development firm.  Understanding what it takes to get everyone on board, and explaining why they should, is half the battle.

After understanding where you want to go and why you need to get there, aligning your organization to pursue this end is the next step.  Continuing to conduct business in the linear, idea smothering way you’ve always done it is not a good start.  Take a bit of advice from Google, who, in 2012, embarked on a journey to discover what created the perfect team and discovered- “psychological safety, more than anything else, was critical to making a team work ([Source](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html?_r=0)).”  

The perfect, innovative team doesn’t come from congregating the smartest people in the world into your conference room - it comes from establishing psychological safety, a place where team members can trust those they work beside and are willing to be vulnerable.  Create an environment where it’s okay to fail, it’s okay to explore and learn from that detour, and compensation isn’t affected by straying from the well-beaten path.

Finally, to begin your innovation journey, consider empowering your organization to self-organize, allowing those of similar passions to seek out like-minded individuals, ardent about the same topics and solutions.  Often, these enthusiastic members are willing to push through difficulties and hurdles when the going gets tough, and will illicit support when they need it most.  Forcing employees to take on extra-work that they’re not excited about will return results that you will be equally thrilled with.
