<b>“Know thy user, for he is not thee.”</b>

No, it’s not a Biblical commandment, though some might argue it could and should be.  Instead, knowing thy user is the mantra of usability engineering and design.  It’s the melodious centering of the designer - the gregorian chant of the developer.  Know thy user, know thy user, know thy user…

For far too long, technology has driven the function and form of business - the structure and design of programs dictate organizational structure, the complexity of systems require specialized employee roles, and, inevitably, no software or technology is useable without training, training, training.

But does it <i>have</i> to be that way?  Do we have to settle for software that requires such a steep learning curve when we have the technology to make it intuitively useable?

I think the answer is no.  

And I imagine a comment like that is going to be tough for many people to hear.  With all of the effort put behind designing software, building it, selling it, improving it, and using it, if there was an easier way, wouldn’t it have already been discovered?

The definition of usability, as outlined by Steve Krug in his book “Don’t Make me Think (Check it out <https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321965515/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0321965515&linkCode=as2&tag=joshuacoffie1-20&linkId=d5e81f077e38871951a8cd85e3bec877>here!), means “making sure that something works well: that a person of average (or even below average) ability and experience can use the thing—whether it’s a Web site, a fighter jet, or a revolving door—for its intended purpose without getting hopelessly frustrated.”  

Does that ring true to anyone?  Ever use software, or a product, that was hopelessly frustrating?  Why was it frustrating?  Would you have found it less frustrating if you had to take a two week course to learn how to use it?

David Platt, a professor of mine, loves this tagline (Read more about it in his <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321466756/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0321466756&linkCode=as2&tag=joshuacoffie1-20&linkId=b7648e32ce1512fece728efe62529154”>book</a>), which he dubs, “Platt’s First, Last, and Only Law of User Experience Design:”

<i>Know thy user for he is not thee.</i>

In essence - those that are designing and building the product are not necessarily those that the product is designed for.  So why should the product be designed as if they were?  

Think about it - how many times have you said, or heard said, “I think this is the way that it should go.  It only makes sense.”  And yet it’s developers, who use these products everyday and who know the complete ins and outs of the product that they designed, who are often treated as the ultimate authority on how something should look or feel.

See if you’ve ever heard this conversation before -

<b>PM or Scrum Master: “So, why did you make it look like that?”

Developer/Architect: “It’s how this tool works.  I mean, look how easy it is to use - you just do this and this and this. ”

PM or Scrum Master:  “It’s kind of confusing - is there an easier way to do it?  How much time would it take to change it up?”

Developer: “I’m not sure we can.”</b> - or - <b> “It’d be redoing everything…  If we do, we’ll fall behind.  We can just show them how to do it and it’ll be fine.  Every piece of software has a learning curve.”</b>

Now, what if we approached the product from a different angle - what if, from the very beginning, we asked the question, <b>“If we were the user Jenny, how would she use the software?  Is this something she would like?  Is there a more intuitive way to build this?”</b>

Perhaps you can see the problem - for a project or product to be user-focused, it needs to start that way from the very beginning.  Stopping development mid-stream to readjust your approach is a great way to destroy morale and get your best talent to leave town.  

But why even place the user first?  

Don Norman, in his book “The Design of Everyday Things (You can find the book <a  href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0465050654/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0465050654&linkCode=as2&tag=joshuacoffie1-20&linkId=cd41351239d29b0af84a2ea057f8b5e1">here</a>),” provides an incredibly important observation of design:

<b>”Experience is critical, for it determines how fondly people remember their interactions. Was the overall experience positive, or was it frustrating and confusing? When our home technology behaves in an uninterpretable fashion we can become confused, frustrated, and even angry—all strong negative emotions. When there is understanding it can lead to a feeling of control, of mastery, and of satisfaction or even pride—all strong positive emotions. Cognition and emotion are tightly intertwined, which means that the designers must design with both in mind.”</b>

Psychological research provides some understanding behind why it’s so important to provide that positive, emotional experience to users (in other words, get them to love what you’ve built!).  As documented by Diana Tamir and Jason Mitchell (Find a copy <a href=“http://www.pnas.org/content/109/21/8038.full”> here</a>), <b>“Humans devote 30-40% of speech output solely to informing others of their own subjective experiences.”</b>  They go further in explaining this phenomenon through a study they conducted, concluding that self-disclosure of personal experiences with others is [especially] intrinsically rewarding, similar, in effect, “as with primary rewards such as food and sex.”

Research from Stanford (found <a href=“http://infolab.stanford.edu/~mor/research/naamanCSCW10.pdf”>here</a>) suggests that <b>80% of content posted on social media consists of announcements to a person’s own immediate experience</b>.  In other words, elicited emotion tends to find itself broadcast on social media channels, informing a user’s group of friends and/or followers as to their experience.

This research is both troubling and fascinatingly opportunistic in the same breath - experiences that illicit a a strong emotional response, whether good or bad, are likely to find themselves manifested in conversation among friends and colleagues.  <b>If you build a product or experience that your user loves, chances are they will tell others</b>.  On the other side of the coin, <b>if your product is difficult or frustrating to use, it is also likely to end up being told to others</b>.  <i>The choice is yours as to which story it will be.</i>

Let’s look at a real-life example we can wrap our brains around.  By now you might be aware of the Avon story - often hailed as the pinnacle example of why usability and designing for the end-user is so incredibly important (Article <a href=http://www.forbes.com/sites/benkepes/2013/12/17/avons-failed-sap-implementation-a-perfect-example-of-enterprise-it-revolution/#1a194fd65b9c”>here</a>).  

In short, Avon spent upwards of $100 million to implement a new SAP solution that was “so difficult to use that “Avon representatives left the company ‘in meaningful numbers,’” resulting in the termination of the project and a massive software deficit as a constant reminder.  

So what went wrong at Avon?  According to Michael Krigsman, an IT analyst and columnist for ZDNet, “the world of consumer software has become easy and simple to use and has trained users to expect that business software will follow a similar model. And if it doesn’t, people are much less patient than they were in the past.”  If this is truly the case, why do we allow our software to be anything but usable and intuitive?  

Here are some ways that we can get our team on board and always place the users first:

1. Visual cues are powerful - create posters of user-personas and make sure everyone reads them

2. When developers ask the question, “how should we make this work?” always defer to the end-user - how would so-and-so expect or like it to be done?

3. As good ideas and new features inevitably surface, prioritize the work based on the importance and benefit to the user, not on “shiny-new-object syndrome.”

4. Conduct usability testing sessions with users who are representative of those who will be using the product.  There is only so much role playing you can do - get direct feedback from your users and get it often.

5. Never accept “this is the way I would do it” or “it looks cool” as justification for how something is designed and developed.
