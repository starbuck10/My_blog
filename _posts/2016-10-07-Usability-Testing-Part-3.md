<b>Properly Leveraging the User Persona</b>

Often, when teams start out designing or developing a product, they want their solution to do everything and to be used by everyone.  It's a lofty goal, but this generally results in the product doing a lot of little things okay, a handful of things very poorly, and it's simply not a realistic business goal.  Money isn't limitless and, as an investor, I don't want to wait 20 years for the never-finished product to finalize when I can make a return on a product that fits a very specific set of users in the here and now.  It's impractical to define such a broad market to build a product for.  Users interact with products differently and this interaction may differ based upon their role, their upbringing, their season of life, or even their personal types.

A user persona helps designers, developers, and engineers get through this kind of situation by giving them a tool to understand the customers they are building a solution.  It brings to life a fictitious, representative user through demographic information, illustrations, and a personalized, well crafted story and allows the team to truly understand who they're designing and building for.  It helps to clarify assumptions, focus the team's goals, and build a set of criteria that is used to prioritize work and feature development throughout development.  The user persona is also used to align senior leadership and the project team on what exactly they're building, the scope of that project, and provides justification for decisions made throughout the development process.

The process of developing a user persona is fairly simple, consisting of 3 main parts: research, analysis, and development.  The research phase is gathering pertinent data from users, academic/industry research, and behavioral/psychological studies that we use to apply to our fictitious user.  The analysis phase incorporates that research and user behavioral data with the wants and needs of our target user, forming the basis of information from which we craft our user persona.  The final phase, development, involves taking those assumptions and facts about our user base and applying a bit of design and creative thinking to build out our fictitious user(s), much in the same way that an author crafts their main characters.

<b>Research</b>

User personas have been around since the early 2000s.  Much of their life, however, they've been used outside of their intended purpose, losing the power behind what they can actually do for a development team.  Jaime Levy does a great job explaining this transition in his book, "UX Strategy" ([found here](http://amzn.to/2e4o6WG)).

"...big interactive agencies... used personas to upsell the research/discovery phase to clients.  When used this way, personas were often laughable caricatures packed full of stereotypical details based on nothing more than marketing data... the personas failed in informing the UX strategy process in a basic way." [47]

What this abbreviated process failed to consider when conducting its limited research was the purpose of the user persona process; personas are about telling stories that help stakeholders better understand and design solutions for their target users.  When stereotypical or unhelpful data infiltrates the user persona, it becomes a designer's up-sell instead of a useful tool for the development team.  We need to keep this in mind when we're conducting our research.

So where and how do we get useful data if marketing stereotypes are unhelpful?  Much in the same way that a primary source is infinitely better than a secondary source, gathering data on your users directly is infinitely better than relying on data conducting by others (we'll talk about other data-points in a minute).

Conducting your own user research is priceless.  Surveys, interviews, and direct observation are the data-points that provide the most useful design information available to you.  Being able to watch how users interact with current solutions, your own prototypes (when you get to that point of the design process), and providing unfiltered responses to your questions ensure that the data you're working with is free from bias, filtering, and unintentional censorship.

So what if you don't have access to users or you're not allowed to speak with users?  If you've been in the world of human-factored design for more than a day, you know this is a problem that nearly every project or team faces.  Senior leadership or the project sponsor inform you that users are unavailable for interviews or testing or that they will happily act as a proxy for their users.  This situation is what David Platt affectionately refers to as the "third-party problem: the party that's writing the check isn't the party using the software." [The Joy of UX, 34]

Firstly, this is a terrible source of data.  Regardless of how empathetic a person is to their user base, they simply cannot emulate the minute layers of idiosyncrasies that come with years of experience, unique upbringing, or habitual behavior.  If we base our user persona on biased or incorrect data in this manner, it's going to be misleading and completely unhelpful for our team.  Working with bad data will always result in poor design decisions, "no data is better than bad data," as they say.  

However, we know that this roadblock can't always be avoided.  So what do you do?  We rely heavily on parallel research efforts to help craft the overall picture of user behavior and have to get creative about how we gather our data, finding willing participants who are similar in nature to your target end-users.

Let's look at readily available data for a minute.

<b>Academic research- </b> often, gathering scientific data behind user behavior is expensive.  From eye-tracking studies to long-term psychological studies, many of the data-points we'd like access to are beyond the reach of feasibility for everyone but research institutions.  Leveraging behavioral and usability data from these institutions helps to craft the underlying question behind why users do the things they do.  Harvard University recently opened a user research center ([details here](http://library.harvard.edu/08272015-1644/user-experience-lab)) and Stanford's Design School is another source of reliable user data.  I've found that leveraging research in psychology, and books like "Predictably Irrational" by Dan Ariely ([here](http://amzn.to/2ecIyoz)) and "Evil by Design" by Chris Nodder([here](http://amzn.to/2dMyLrr)), are also great places to start if you need some help getting plugged in.  An example of fantastic psychological research would be Vanderbilt University's work in understanding how people learn([found here](https://cft.vanderbilt.edu/guides-sub-pages/how-people-learn/)), which can help in the design of products or services that aren't as simple as an every-day iPhone app.

<b>Industry research- </b> another fantastic set of data comes from analytics and telemetry collected by companies like Google and Nielson Norman Group.  These organizations readily offer data that can help craft our user persona.  Quite frequently, gathering a statistical expectation of 30+ data-points (or users offering feedback, in our case), to reasonably expect a valid analysis based on normal distribution, is out of reach, either based on budget or time restrictions.  For this reason, we can rely on data from these larger organizations to extrapolate certain behaviors across a larger grouping of people.  For instance, we interviewed 5 users and found that 3 of our users rely heavily on their mobile phone to purchase all of their wardrobe.  We can take this smaller dataset and validate our findings using Google's research as a sanity check to our findings.  Do we find that a majority of users exhibit the same behavior or did we interview a subset of our user base that isn't truly representative of who we want to design a product for?

<b>Analysis</b>

After gathering pertinent data behind our expected end-users, we must begin analyzing what we've found.  Often, this data will show that there are a few groups of users that you'd like to target, each with their own desires and expectations.  This is perfectly normal and is a good indicator that you've done a decent job in the data gathering process.  Group this data into it's natural user segments before you begin to draw insights from what you see.  I've found as few groupings as 3 or 4 and upwards of 12 through this process.

After the user data is segmented, allow the data to determine where you go next with your analysis,  keeping in mind that we need to be highly analytical throughout this process, not drawing upon stereotypes and assumptions to determine our take-aways.  Let's say we find from our research that the majority of users can be classified into generational norms: 50% of our target users are Millenials, 30% are Gen-X, and 20% are Baby-Boomers.  The marketing side of our brains may wish to stop here, drawing upon commonly inferred assumptions about their willingness to adopt new technologies, their propensity to features, or their expectations of design.  Instead, I would encourage you to go deeper.  Are the Gen-X users highly technical because the application you're looking to build is targeting IT professionals?  Is there an expectation that they must see the data before they're willing to make a decision, instead of relying on colorful metrics?  

We can't forget that personas focus on user behavior and the underlying drivers that affect that behavior - it's not enough to say that a user is a "super-user" or has trouble using technology, a persona must go deeper to answer the questions developers will inevitably ask - "Would Sallie find this beneficial?" or even "Does she even want this feature?".

What kind of data are we looking for in this process?  I've found that if we keep the purpose of the user persona in mind, the information we need to create our fictitious users include:

1. <b>A picture</b> of our user that is representative of who will be using the product.  A picture is worth a thousand words and allows our team to visually resurrect the user we're designing for.  Instead of designing to the description of "for a baby-boomer with a propensity to get his hands dirty, find an image of that user and save your team from imagining 12 different people, all following similar descriptions.

2. <b>Biographical data</b> includes putting a name to a face, age, gender, and any other information that is relevant to our user.

3. <b>Personality traits</b> provide insight into the inner-workings and behavior of our user.  These traits are referred to as "grokkability items," from the term, "grok," coined by Robert Heinlein, and help our team "understand intuitively or by empathy..." the user that they're designing for.   The idea is that we include our user's pet peeves, a quote they would live their life by, what their friends would say about them, or any other component of their personality that might affect the design of our product.  Be creative but always make sure the traits you're giving this user are actionable and answer the underlying question behind that user's behavior.  

4. <b>Desires, wants, and needs</b> paint a picture of what our user must have in a solution.  If they value usability and getting the job done (function) over how the solution looks (form), then let's make sure this is brought to the attention of our team.  Should our user value comparing prices before they make a decision or desire lowest price over a custom fit, our team should have a sense of where they put their value hours into the development of a solution.

5. <b>Current solution</b> or the workaround/way that the user accomplishes their goals today.  If you're looking at building a product that helps the elderly contact a loved one in the chance they take a nasty spill, what solutions are out there today?  Does this user leverage those solutions or do they have a workaround that works better than paying for something that expensive?  These are the kinds of questions that give our team insight into our design but go much deeper than the superficial user segmentation that we're used to seeing in marketing research or focus-groups.  Leverage the user persona to bridge those gaps.

6. <b>Technology or product interaction</b> is dependent on each product in question.  Teams that are looking to design a software solution may be very interested in the devices that a user owns or defaults to when doing certain tasks.  Product designers may care more about the user's opinion about materials, craftsmanship, price, frequency of use for similar products, and other interaction points.  This is where it's really important to choose information that will be actionable for your team and the specific product that you're designing.

7. <b>A relatable story</b> is the final component of the user persona.  Although this is the more creative aspect of the persona and you may tempted to skip it, I encourage you not to.  Humans are natural story-tellers.  These relatable tales help us understand and apply difficult concepts and engage the creative portions of our brains, producing empathy and insight where straight facts never can.  This story is a chance to help your team put themselves in their users' shoes and rounds out the persona.

<b>Development</b>

After performing user interviews, conducting research, and building out a picture of who your end-users are, the development phase is where everything is put together in a product for the team to use.  In the beginning of this post I mentioned that you might have a handful of potential users for your product.  No more than 3 should make it past this point (2 is ideal).  Having more than a primary and secondary user for the product (or at most, 3) will lead to a conflict of prioritization and desires while designing the product, leading to down-time when those conflicts of interest cannot be resolved.  

The ideal user persona should be about a page in length and both the primary and secondary user personas should be used as large information radiators within the design and development team rooms, always remaining front of mind when decisions are made.  The bigger the poster the better, reminding each member of the team who they're designing the product for.  

These personas can also be used to justify decisions of prioritization and design changes to senior leadership to reinforce the necessity and applicability of these decisions, especially when senior leaders might be far removed from the actual users of the product.

The user persona is a living and breathing document that should be updated throughout the development process.  As new information is discovered about users through usability testing, these trends and discoveries should further enhance our understanding of the user we're designing for.
