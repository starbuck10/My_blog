<b>Properly Leveraging the User Persona</b>

Often, when teams start out designing or developing a product, they want their solution to do everything and to be used by everyone.  It's a lofty goal, but this generally results in the product doing a lot of little things okay, a handful of things very poorly, and it's simply not a realistic business goal.  Money isn't limitless and, as an investor, I don't want to wait 20 years for the never-finished product to finalize when I can make a return on a product that fits a very specific set of users in the here and now.  It's impractical to define such a broad market to build a product for.  Users interact with products differently and this interaction may differ based upon their role, their upbringing, their season of life, or even their personal types.

A user persona helps designers, developers, and engineers get through this kind of situation by giving them a tool to understand the customers they are building a solution.  It brings to life a fictitious, representative user through demographic information, illustrations, and a personalized story and allows the team to truly understand who they're designing and building for.  It helps to clarify assumptions, focus the team's goals, and build a set of criteria that is used to prioritize work and feature development.  The user persona is also used to align senior leadership and the project team on what exactly they're building, the scope of that project, and provides justification for decisions made throughout the development process.







Personas are about telling stories that help stakeholders better understand and design solutions.

Personas focus on user behavior and the underlying drivers that affect that behavior - it's not enough to say that a user is a "super-user" or has trouble using technology, a persona must go deeper to answer the questions developers will inevitably ask - "Would Sallie find this beneficial?" or even "Does she even want this feature?".

The behaviors should be authentic and most definitely not a stereotype.
