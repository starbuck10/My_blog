	Originating Template:

		Free for personal and commercial use under the CCA 3.0 license (html5up.net/license)


		This is Twenty, a minimal, multi-page responsive site template for HTML5 UP.

		As the name implies, this is my twentieth (!) design for HTML5 UP. Since the last
		few have been single page affairs, I decided to go with something a bit more conventional
		and threw in four extra page layouts. Beyond that, it's the usual drill: fully responsive,
		built on HTML5/CSS3/skel, and CCA licensed like all my other stuff. Sass sources are
		also included for those of you into that sort of thing (entirely optional).
